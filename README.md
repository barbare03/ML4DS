*Erasmus+ Blended Intensive Programmes:*

Within the framework of the new Erasmus+ programme period (2021-2027) the Polytechnic Institute of Bragan√ßa (IPB, Portugal) and its European partners offer Blended Intensive Programmes (BIP).

BIP are short and intensive training programmes, including online cooperation by combining physical mobility with a virtual part, and promoting and using innovative ways of learning and teaching, research-based and challenge-based learning. The virtual part will allow the participation in teaching/training of experts from all partners. The physical short-term mobility will allow the face-to-face cooperation of teachers and participants.
